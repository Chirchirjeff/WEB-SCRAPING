# Flipkart Mobile Scraper 📱💻  

## Project Overview  
This project is a **web scraper** that extracts information about **mobile phones under ₹50,000** from Flipkart. Using Python, I automated the process of collecting **phone names, prices, and descriptions** from multiple pages. The extracted data is stored in a CSV file for easy access and analysis.

## Features 🚀  
✅ Scrapes mobile phone data from **Flipkart**  
✅ Extracts the **name, price, and description** of each phone  
✅ Handles **multiple pages** for a complete dataset  
✅ Uses **website animation techniques** (like delays or scroll simulation) to avoid detection  
✅ Stores extracted data in a structured **CSV file**  

## Technologies Used 🛠  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Requests** – for sending HTTP requests  
- **BeautifulSoup** – for parsing HTML  
- **Pandas** – for storing and processing data  
- **Time & Random Delays** – to mimic human behavior
